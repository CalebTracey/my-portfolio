### [live site](https://calebtracey.com)

This is my heavily over-engineered portfolio website. 

Formatted as a single page application, this page also uses a top/bottom parallax scroll animation.

I built it to sharpen my skills with typescript and to learn more about animations and sass.

The main technologies used are react, react-spring, sass, and material-ui.

## Running locally

In the project directory, use:

### `yarn start`
